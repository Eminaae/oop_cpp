# Exercise 2

Create a class containing a double and a print( ) function that prints
the double. In main( ), create pointers to members for both the data member
and the function in your class. Create an object of your class and a pointer
to that object, and manipulate both class elements via your pointers to members,
using both the object and the pointer to the object.
